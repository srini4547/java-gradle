* If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent,
* the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead.
* If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".
* A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more
* than the opponent.
